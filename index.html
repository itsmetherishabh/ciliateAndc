      <h3 class="intro-heading">Introduction</h3>
      <p class="intro-data">
        Ciliated protists (Ciliates) are a highly diverse clade of eukaryotic micro-organisms that are morphologically very complex and highly differentiated taxa among single-celled organisms. They exhibit high species diversity, with over 4000 free-living ciliates described. Ciliates have a number of distinctive structural and functional features, such as their extremely complex subcellular and organellar structures, structurally and functionally different macronuclear and micronuclear genomes, sexual reproduction by conjugation, whole genome duplications, patterns of cortical structure with semi-autonomous mechanisms of inheritance and morphogenesis, evidence of epigenetic mechanisms, broad array of ecological niches and lifestyles, and rapid evolutionary radiation at the species population level owing to their short generation times. Their role is immense as they are part of the microbial loop, function as recyclers, remineralizers of organic material in terrestrial and aquatic systems, they prey upon the bacteria and smaller protists and maintain the ecosystem balance. These distinctive characteristics make them extremely useful models in studies of cell biology, molecular biology, genetics, ecology and evolution. They have been used extensively as model systems for assessing heavy metal toxicity in freshwater ecosystems, to detect stress-induced morphological anomalies and in the expression of genes such as hsp70, superoxide dismutase and metallothionein.

      <h3 class="intro-heading">Research Interests</h3>
      <p class="intro-data">
        Heavy metal induced oxidative stress response in spirotrich ciliates Heavy metal pollution of water is of major concern these days especially in developing countries like India. Anthropogenic sources, mainly mining and industrial activities, have contributed to substantial increase in heavy metal content in air and in many terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. About 85 percent of the water pollution is caused by domestic and industrial sources. A wide range of contaminants are continuously introduced into the water and among these contaminants, heavy metals due to their toxicity, accumulation and non-degradable nature, constitute one of the most dangerous groups. Prolonged exposure to heavy metals such as cadmium, copper, lead and zinc disturb normal biological function and evoke cellular stress response. The research interest of our group is to examine how spirotrich ciliates respond to metal stress and to see the expression of heat shock proteins, metallothioneins and glutathione peroxidase gene under heavy metal stress.. Moreover, the transcriptional activity of these genes are studied following heavy metals stress. The change in transcriptional activity can be used as a biomarker for monitoring the pollution level. Cellular response to heavy metals may also leads to generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which can be used as a tool in using whole cell ciliate as biosensor.

      <h3 class="intro-heading">Biodiversity of spirotrich ciliates</h3>
      <p class="intro-data">
        We are also focusing on taxonomic description of freshwater ciliates by using morphological and molecular markers. We isolate and identify the ciliates from freshwater source in and around Delhi by studying its morphology, morphogenetic stages and using molecular markers like 18S rRNA gene, ITS1 and 2, histone gene etc. Extremophilic ciliates have been catalogued from a wide variety of regions such as hot water springs, caves, high altitudes etc. Ciliate communities have also been described from Biodiversity Hotspots such as Silent Valley Bioreserve and Eastern Himalayas. These have paid rich dividends in terms of endemism and distribution patterns. Fresh Water ciliate communities as bio-indicators of water pollution One of the present assignments deals with physic-chemical analyses of water and correlation with ciliate communities in water sources around the National Capital region.
      </p>
      <h3 class="intro-heading">Assessment of soil quality by using ciliates as bio-indicators</h3>
      <p class="intro-data">
        In our laboratory, presently ten undergraduate students are also working under DU-innovation project (AND-303). They are studying physico-chemical and biological analysis of soil samples collected from various regions in Delhi to assess the soil quality of these areas. Physico-chemical analysis of soil involves determination of soil texture, water holding capacity, pH, conductivity, nitrogen content, carbon content etc. and biological analysis involves identification of soil ciliates by live cell observations and staining techniques. The objective of this investigation.
